# weather-dashboard

## Description
Weather Dashboard allows users to search the weather in US cities. Users will enter a city to search and the application will display current and future weather conditions. The application uses localStorage to store persistent data so that when users click on a city in the search history, the weather data is presented again.

This application uses the Open Weather Map API for its weather data. Documentation can be found [here](https://openweathermap.org/api).
